first we started with data source which it
 the "listEmployees" the we converted to stream
Employee then we started some intermediate 
operations like filter and map ~ the filter operation 
returnn for us the stream of "Employee" with employees 
that have salary more than or equal 800 and less than
 1200, then we mapped that stream to return 
 a new Stream of type Employee have 2% extra(raise 2% on salary) on their salaries, after that we made a mutable 
reduction operation (Collect) eturns a new collection have deprtments name and number of employees in each, Lastly
 we used the forEeach (Terminal Operation) to print the data.
